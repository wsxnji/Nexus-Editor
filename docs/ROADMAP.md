# Nexus Editor Roadmap

This document maps every planned feature to **package ownership / priority / status / OpenSpec linkage**.

[中文版](./ROADMAP.zh.md)

- Any item added to the roadmap should be registered here as one row first, then decide whether it needs an OpenSpec proposal.
- Status values: `planned` / `in-progress` / `blocked` / `done` (merged to `main`) / `dropped`.
- Priority: `P0` (current iteration) / `P1` (next) / `P2` (mid-term) / `P3` (long-term).
- "Needs OpenSpec" — whether the item must go through `openspec/changes/` (see `CONTRIBUTING.md` §3.1).

## Maintenance

1. **Adding an item**: append a row in the matching section with the next number; mention it in the PR description.
2. **Status transitions**: start work → `in-progress`; merged → `done`; abandon → `dropped` (keep the row for traceability).
3. **Priority adjustments**: maintainers re-balance at each iteration kickoff — don't tweak priorities as drive-by edits in feature PRs.
4. **OpenSpec linkage**: once an item enters the OpenSpec flow, fill its `openspec/changes/<id>/` link into the row's "Notes" column.
